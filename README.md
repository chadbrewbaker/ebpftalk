* eBPF -> lcov?

* towards crypto signed data lineage

* Bolt/propeller - link permuations and live function splitting for cache efficency - can we eBPF to re-link on the fly for iterative code (molecular dynamics, CFD, ..., rebuilds of a codebase) ?

* eBPF feedback to generate upstream AST matchers for static lints in the CI.

* eBPF expectation tests - could we have eBPF in the browser? Analoge to Neo - re-writing the IO?  Could eBPF be used to create a jHipster on steroids?
